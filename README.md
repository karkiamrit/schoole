## Backend Overview

The backend of the School and Academic Event Management Platform is designed to handle data management, user authentication, and business logic efficiently. It provides a robust API to serve requests from the frontend while ensuring secure and scalable data handling.

### Key Components

- **GraphQL API**: 
  - Utilizes GraphQL to provide a flexible API that allows clients to request only the data they need. This reduces over-fetching and improves performance. The API supports various queries and mutations for creating, updating, and retrieving event data, user information, and analytics.

- **PostgreSQL Database**: 
  - The platform uses PostgreSQL as the relational database management system. It stores all event-related data, user profiles, and other necessary information in a structured format. PostgreSQLâ€™s robust querying capabilities and support for complex data types allow for efficient data management and retrieval.

- **User Authentication**: 
  - Implements secure user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). This ensures that users can safely log in and access their accounts while protecting sensitive data. Role-based access control is implemented to manage permissions for students, teachers, and administrators.

- **Data Validation and Error Handling**: 
  - The backend includes comprehensive data validation to ensure that only valid data is processed. Error handling mechanisms are in place to provide meaningful feedback to the frontend, helping to improve user experience.

- **Scalability and Performance**: 
  - Designed with scalability in mind, the backend can handle a growing number of users and events efficiently. Caching strategies can be implemented to improve performance for frequently accessed data, reducing the load on the database.

### Technology Stack

- **Node.js**: The backend is built using Node.js, providing a non-blocking, event-driven architecture that is ideal for handling multiple requests simultaneously.
- **Nest.js**: A lightweight framework for building RESTful APIs and handling server-side logic.
- **Apollo Server**: Used for integrating GraphQL into the Node.js application, simplifying the development of the GraphQL API.
- **TypeORM**: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for managing database interactions with PostgreSQL, making it easier to perform CRUD operations.

This architecture ensures that the backend is robust, maintainable, and capable of supporting the platform's growing needs. By leveraging modern technologies and best practices, we aim to provide a seamless experience for users engaging with the platform.
